The output of

consists of comma-separated rows of dive number, time (seconds since
start of the dive), depth (metres), and temperature (celsius).
The depth and temperature fields may be empty.
.Pp
For each diver
.Pq this is an empty string if there's no given diver ,
an array of all dives.
Dives consist of a
.Li num ,
the dive number as exported from

and the optional date-time stamp (UNIX epoch).
Dives are sorted in order of increasing
.Li datetime .
If the
.Li datetime
is not provided, they come last.
What follows that are the samples.
