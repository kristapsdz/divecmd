.Nm divecmd2json
.Nd export dives to JSON
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm divecmd2json
.Op Fl av
.Op Ar files...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility accepts XML files generated by
.Xr divecmd 1
and exports dive profiles to JSON.
Its arguments are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl a
Show sample times relative to the first dive's start time.
This is useful for free-diving where multiple dives are done in
sequence.
.It Fl v
Parse files in verbose mode.
.It Ar files...
XML input files with one or more dives.
.El
.Ss Output
The output of
.Nm
has the following structure:
.Bd -literal
{"divecmd2json":
  {"version": "0.0.1",
   "divers": [
.Ed
.Pp
Each instance has a root of
.Li divecmd2json ,
followed by the version number.
An array of all divers comes next.
.Bd -literal
    {"dives": [
      {"num": 41,
       "datetime": 1483178882,
       "samples": [
.Ed
.Pp
For each diver, an array of all dives.
Dives consist of a
.Li num ,
the dive number as exported from
.Xr divecmd 1 ,
and the optional date-time stamp (UNIX epoch).
Dives are sorted in order of increasing
.Li datetime .
If the
.Li datetime
is not provided, they come last.
What follows that are the samples.
.Bd -literal
        {"time": 0, "depth": 1.28, "temp": 16},
        {"time": 20, "depth": 2.32, "temp": 16},
        {"time": 40, "depth": 1.35, "temp": 16},
        ]
      }]
    }]
  }
}
.Ed
.Pp
Samples always consist of a
.Li time ,
in seconds from the start of the dive, and optionally contain a
.Li depth
.Pq in metres
and
.Li temp
.Pq in celsius .
