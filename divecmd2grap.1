.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility accepts XML files generated by
.Xr divecmd 1
and graphs each dive's depths in the
.Xr grap 1
data format.
By default, dives start at time zero through their maximum time.
Multiple dives are superimposed.
Its arguments are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl a
Accumulate dives instead of showing them stacked: dives start at their
real time relative to the first dive moment.
This is useful for free-diving where multiple dives are done in
sequence.
.It Fl s
Standalone mode.
Prints out the
.Xr grap 1
document around the data.
.It Fl t
Print
.Dq topside :

Usually dive computers will start under the surface.
This helps to join dives prettily.
This is often used with
.Fl s .
.It Fl v
Parse files in verbose mode.
.It Ar files...
XML input files with one or more dives.
.El

documented is also emitted.
