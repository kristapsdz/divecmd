.Nm divecmd2divecmd
.Nd manipulate files produced by divecmd
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm divecmd2divecmd
.Op Fl jsv
.Op Ar
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility accepts divelog files produced by
.Xr divecmd 1
and manipulates their contents.
.Pp
With the
.Fl s
and
.Fl j
flag,
.Nm
splits apart or joins its dives, respectively.
Splitting is useful for establishing
.Dq canonical free dive mode ,
wherein each dive in a sequence has its own dive profile and surface
time is omitted.
Many dive computers automatically produce canonical free diving mode,
for example, the Suunto D6i.
Others, like the HW OSTC 2C, do not.
Joining is useful when exporting data into Subsurface, which expects a
single dive profile.
.Pp
If dives already are split,
.Fl s
is a noop; same goes with
.Fl j
and dives already being joined.
.Pp
If invoked using neither
.Fl j
nor
.Fl s ,
the input is replicated on output.
.Pp
The only other argument is
.Fl v ,
which triggers verbose parsing.
.Pp
.Nm
produces output on standard output compatible with
.Xr divecmd 1 .
.Sh EXIT STATUS
.Ex -std
